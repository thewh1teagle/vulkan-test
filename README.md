# Vulkan test

Simple program to test that Vulkan runtime works (macOS / Linux / Windows).

Once you run it, it will try to load vulkan dynamic library and create instance. 

Then it will show success / error dialog.

On Windows you can try download [vulkan runtime](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home) and place `vulkan-1.dll` in the same folder
